## [Watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFrI5xh82Qk)

Nice clean Weather Android App UI built using Jetpack Compose. Single screen app design shows the current temperature, humidity, UV index, information about wind, and time of sunset and sunrise for the selected location. At the top of the screen is also located a self-explanatory image for faster understanding.
